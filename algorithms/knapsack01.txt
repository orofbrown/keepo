Given to `n`-tuples of positive numbers:
  a[1..n] and b[1..n]
and B > 0, determine the subset
  T that maximizes v[i] subject to w[i] <= W

Or

Suppose we have a knapsack which can hold up to `W` weight units
We have a total of `n` items to choose from
  Whose values are represented by an array  `v`
  And whose weights represented by an array `w`
