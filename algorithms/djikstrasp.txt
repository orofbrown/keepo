Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Given a set of `n` edges
Determine `n` nodes
Mark each node unvisited
Assign each node very large/inifinite distance value
Set init_node as current node
For each node between init and final:
    For each unvisited neighbor:
        Calculate distance from current node
        If distance exists:
            Compare the two and keep the smaller
        Else:
            Save current value
    Mark visited (visited nodes should not be checked again)
    If current node is also final node:
        exit
    Else:
        set next closest node to current
